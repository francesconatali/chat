A chat app built with Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, Bootstrap, SCSS, jQuery, DOMPurify, inLine.js, Vanta.js and deployed on <a href="https://francesco-node-chat.herokuapp.com">Heroku</a>. A lot of stuff for a little and fun app! :)
<br><br>
Although there are many chat apps, I wanted to challenge myself by developing my own. I had good fun with this project, and something like this lends itself to many potential additional features. To test it, you can simply open this app on several tabs/windows and chat with yourself. Or let me know and if I can I'll join you :) Technically speaking, it should support up to 300k concurrent connections!
